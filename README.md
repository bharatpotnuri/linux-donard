PMEM: The Persistent Memory Driver + ext4 Direct Access (DAX)
=========================================================

PMEM is basically a modified version of the Block RAM Driver, BRD.  The major
difference is that BRD allocates its backing store pages from the page cache,
whereas PMEM uses reserved memory that has been ioremapped.  The benefit of this
approach is that there is a direct mapping between filesystem block numbers and
virtual addresses.

In PMEM, filesystem blocks N, N+1, N+2, etc. will all be adjacent in the virtual
memory space.  This property will hopefully allow us to set up PMD mappings (2
MiB) for DAX.

To use PMEM, you need to set up some reserved memory for it.  Here are the
additions I made for my system with 64 GiB of RAM:

1) Reserve memory via the "memmap" kernel parameter in grub 1's menu.lst:

<pre>
title		Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 3.13.0+
root		(hd1,0)
kernel		/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0+ root=UUID=fbb9c4ad-ca73-481d-affc-b0230f262333 ro memmap=32G$32G
initrd		/boot/initrd.img-3.13.0+
</pre>

2) Set up the correct kernel configuration options for PMEM in .config.

<pre>
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM=m
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM_START=32
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM_COUNT=4
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PMEM_SIZE=32
</pre>

If you intend to use DAX, you should also have this option enabled:

<pre>
CONFIG_FS_DAX=y
</pre>

This configuration gave me four pmem devices, each with 8 GiB of space:

<pre>
# fdisk -l /dev/pmem*

This tree also includes v10 of Matthew Wilcox's patchset which adds DAX
functionality to ext4.

You can use DAX with PMEM by making an ext4 on your new /dev/pmem<N> devices
and then mounting them with the "dax" option:

<pre>
# mkdir /mnt/mem
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/pmem0
# mount -o dax /dev/pmem0 /mnt/mem
# mount | fgrep /mnt/mem
/dev/pmem0 on /mnt/mem type ext4 (rw,dax)
# df -h | fgrep /mnt/mem
/dev/pmem0            7.8G   18M  7.4G   1% /mnt/mem
</pre>
